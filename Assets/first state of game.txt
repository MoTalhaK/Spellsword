You wake up only to find yourself locked in a prsion cell. 
"What is this, where - where am i?".
A stranger in the cell next to you begins speaking.
"You really don't remember? You killed the King's son!"
You are unable to recall any of this and know there must
be some sort of mistake. "I need to find a way out of here."

What's my move?
1. Wait for a guard to pass by and steal his keys.
2. Wait for execution day and make a run for it.
