  storyText: 'You activate the power of light and The Spellsword becomes covered
    in bright yellow flames. The King has transformed into an almost demon-like creature
    with horns sticking out from his head. He attempts to strike you but the yellow
    flames easily deflect his attack.


    What''s my move?

    1. Direct your
    yellow flames at the King.

    2. Wait for his next move.'
