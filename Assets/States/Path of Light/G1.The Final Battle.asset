  storyText: 'You quietly maneuver through the traps while taking out both of the
    guards with a bolt of lightning from The Spellsword, one of its many fascinating
    capabilities. You enter through the door ahead. "I have been waiting for you,
    warrior! You''d be a fool to think you can challenge me! I have gained the power
    of the gods, a mere mortal could never defeat me!" And so the fight begins.


    What''s
    my move?

    1. Shoot a bolt of lightning from The Spellsword.

    2. Charge
    in.'
