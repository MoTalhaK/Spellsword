  storyText: 'You dodge his attack and are able to land a blow on him. Blood gushes
    out from his arm. The King is enraged. You hear him say the words "Sayum en darkum"
    (Darkness, give me power!) and suddenly dark flames shroud the King as he begins
    to transform. "I told you you cannot defeat me! The darkness shall prevail!"
    The Spellsword begins to glow brightly.


    What''s my move?

    1. Use the
    power of light.

    2. Strike him to stop the transformation.'
