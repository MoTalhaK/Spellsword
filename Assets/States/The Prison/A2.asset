  storyText: 'You manage to swipe the keys off the guard as he walks by. "I need
    to get out of here quick before he notices the keys are missing." You unlock
    the cell and make a run for it but one of the guards spots you and starts running
    after you. "Crap. Where was he hiding?!?" All of a sudden, out of nowhere, a
    strange portal appears on the side of the wall.


    What''s my move?

    1.
    Face the guard head on.

    2. Enter the mysterious portal.'
